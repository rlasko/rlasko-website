        <h6>Explore opportunities to bring back respect for people’s perceptual-motor skills and the sensuous/sensory nature of their bodies when designing a new instance of a control that people interact with in the physical world. First, find a real-world control that needs to be improved. Next, re-imagine the control and design it as a physical point of interaction that communicates these three things:</h6>
          <div class="paragraph_container">
            <h6 class="paragraph1">1] Perceptual Affordance:  How the control communicates the action a user can take.</h6>
            <h6 class="paragraph1">2] Feedforward:  How the control communicates what the likely outcome of an action might be.</h6>
            <h6 class="paragraph1">3] Feedback:  How the control communicates its response to the user input.</h6>
          </div>
        <h6>Simple 3D prototyping techniques as well as light and sound, will be used to explore many possibilities and to embody the final design.</h6>

          <h6 class="paragraph">“When I worked on a client’s MacBook, I always returned the adapter with the cable wrapped around the wings, and most of my customers commented on it, saying, “Oh, I didn’t know those were there” (or words to that effect).”</h6>

          <h6 class="paragraph">“I replace my charger every 2 years due to fraying”</h6>

        <h6>The tape measurer “cord” clicks as the user pulls, providing perceptual affordance. The only part of the object that can be picked up is clearly the end of the charger head and the bit of cord that peeks out suggests it can be pulled. There is no protruding button in this version yet but the button on the tape measurer falls squarely on the thumb or forefinger of the user (depending on which hand is used). </h6>

        <h6>Because the prototype was made out of paper, it was extremely light in comparison to the real thing and users were hesitant to pick it up and pull the cord because it seemed fragile.

        <h6 class="sub_subhead">Prototype Iteration #3</h6>
        <h6>I knew to get the feel I wanted, a paper prototype wouldn’t cut it. Rounded edges and nice buttons were beyond my exacto knife skills, and however hard I tried, the paper box wouldn’t be able to overcome users’ hesitation to pull on the cord with any roughness. <b>Solution: 3D printer</b></h6>

        <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Final Prototype</h6>

        <h6>Though there were a few flaws in this prototype, it was a huge improvement over the previous. The end of the cord wasn’t quite flush with the charger body as I envisioned, and the paint job could have definitely been done better. The cardboard plug was a little strange compared to the 3D printed body, though overall it got the job done.</h6>

        </div>
        <h6>This iteration was much sturdier than the previous ones and users responded with more confidence. The button is where the hand naturally grips and helps prevent injury from the cord rewinding too fast. The slight resistance from the spring of the button provides a nice haptic feedback for the user as the cords winds itself back up. The magnet provides firm feedback when the connector is finished wrapping. The end of the charger is slightly narrower than the body of the charger, providing a visual affordance and grip for users to pick it up. Pulling it reveals the cord and a clicking sound from the charger as it unwinds both provide feedback. Since there are only two possible things users can do with the charger - push the button and pull the end of the cord, feedforward is built into the control.</h6>
