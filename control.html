        <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">The Project</h6>
        <h6>Explore opportunities to bring back respect for people’s perceptual-motor skills and the sensuous/sensory nature of their bodies when designing a new instance of a control that people interact with in the physical world. First, find a real-world control that needs to be improved. Next, re-imagine the control and design it as a physical point of interaction that communicates these three things:</h6>
          <div class="paragraph_container">
            <h6 class="paragraph1">1] Perceptual Affordance:  How the control communicates the action a user can take.</h6>
            <h6 class="paragraph1">2] Feedforward:  How the control communicates what the likely outcome of an action might be.</h6>
            <h6 class="paragraph1">3] Feedback:  How the control communicates its response to the user input.</h6>
          </div>
        <h6>Simple 3D prototyping techniques as well as light and sound, will be used to explore many possibilities and to embody the final design.</h6>
