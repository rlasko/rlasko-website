          <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">About Conversational User Interfaces</h6>
          <h6>In recent years, conversational user interfaces (CUIs) have become more popular with the most advanced offering something approaching a fluent, spoken conversation between humans and machines. Conversational interaction can benefit users in situations where their hands and/or their visual attention are not available, such as when driving a car or cooking in a kitchen. They also help in situations where the user’s needs do not map well to the hierarchical information structure of many online systems, which make it tedious to drill down for terse information.</h6>
          <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">The Project</h6>
          <h6>Research and prototype a conversational user interface that reimagines the retail dressing room experience. In particular, the solution should find harmony between the CUI's functional and interactive form.<br/>Avi Romanoff, Sharon Rajkumar, Rae Lasko<br/>Spring 2017   |   3 weeks</h6>

          <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Exploratory Scenarios and Preliminary Exploration</h6>
          <h6>We then imagined a variety of possible futures with CUIs in the retail space and narrowed it down to three:</h6>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Bring the dressing room home: A touch screen projector is attached to a regular mirror that makes it smart. A virtual stylist answers questions about choice of clothes and also make suggestions on what to purchase. You can ask the CUI to suggest jewelry, shoes, bags and other outfits. Add shortlisted items to a trunk. Trunk is sent home. Keep only the ones you want.</li>
            <li>A customer browses clothes on her favorite store’s website. She adds a bunch of clothes she wants to try out to the store’s dressing room. Later that afternoon she visits the store and checks in with the CUI outside the dressing room. An associate arrives with refreshments for her to enjoy while the dressing room is stocked with the clothes she had wanted to try on.</li>
            <li>A customer is in the dressing room and wants to ask her friend Emily what she thinks of the blouse she has tried on. She asks the room to start a FaceTime call with Emily. The room agrees and soon Emily appears in a live chat window on the mirror.</li>
          </ul>
          <h6>We decided to choose the first scenario because our research and competitive analysis showed that people were uncomfortable speaking out loud in a public dressing room especially about sensitive topics (“Can I get a bigger size?”). We also found untapped potential in the online shopping space where consumers are hesitant to make purchases without first seeing what clothing would look on them. Additionally, we chose to make the CUI a fashion assistant that makes recommendations because we found that consumers often seek the advice of friends but worry they may not be impartial. Finally, we opted to send users a trunk of the clothing they select for try-on purposes to further decrease the users’ perceived risk of online shopping.</h6>

          <h6 class="sub_subhead">Use Cases:</h6>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Planning what to wear for special occasions</li>
            <li>Shopping from home with in-store dressing room experience</li>
            <li>Finding matching accessories for outfit</li>
          </ul>

          <h6 class="sub_subhead">How It Works Overview:</h6>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>User interface is a mirror</li>
            <li>The conversation is displayed as an overlay</li>
            <li>Whenever relevant, the user use the touchscreen</li>
            <li>However the interaction is primarily speech based</li>

          <h6 class="sub_subhead">Major Revisions from Previous Iteration:</h6>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>We thought that the users’ propensity for touching the screen instead of talking were mainly due to the classroom environment and the WOZ setup that encouraged users to tap. To combat this we built a higher fidelity interface that is able to give feedforward for speaking in the form of a moving audio wave, and is less distracting because there is no WOZ. We chose to keep the multi-modality input recognition for accessibility and to allow users the option to not disturb others in their home.</li>
            <li>Instead of matching the gender of the agent to the user, we opted for an androgynous CUI to avoid alienating non-cisgendered users.</li>
            <li>To address the awkward transitions from the voice interface to the touch interface and vice versa, we added audio and visual feedback.</li>
            <li>We added a physical shutter that is operated solely by the user to promote the perception of control and privacy.</li>
            <li>We decided to focus our final demo on one aspect of the CUI that we did not explore in detail before - color selection and theory</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col l8">
              <h6>We decided to pitch our project as an Amazon product called Amazon EchoView. Amazon would sell the units at cost to consumers and every purchase made using the device would receive a nominal discount. Amazon’s profits would come from the increased purchases made by consumers and consumers would purchase the device as an investment. Though Amazon would be the primary retailer, other companies would be able to build plugins for their own catalogue, much as Amazon’s Alexa has “skills”. We chose to make our CUI, Ash, an androgynous sibling of Alexa’s who’s persona is specialized to their job - helping people make clothing decisions. One of Ash’s specialties is color theory where they detect the two primary colors the user is wearing and suggest a third accent color in the form of an accessory. Ash is wholly integrated into Amazon’s e-commerce purchasing platform and is able to both suggest items from the user’s past purchases as well as new items from the catalog.</h6>
