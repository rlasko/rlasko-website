            <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Process</h6>
            <h6>I completed a competitve analysis and did user research, including interviews as well assessing online reviews and the complaints log. Then I prototyped the system on paper, soliciting feedback from team members and other interns. I was limited to these groups due to confidentiality rules.</h6>
            <h6>Throughout the process, I made both design decisions regarding how the user interacted with the feature and their overall mental model of it. The system architecture and protocol design I used ultimately affects the ability of my team members to later access and modify the code that I wrote. The overall design will be a critical consideration when evaluating my feature for release.</h6>

        <h6>At the end of the 11 week internship, I finished implementing the first version of my feature, and made modifications through the standard review process. I also presented my final product and process work to a Senior Director and many managers in my department.</h6>
