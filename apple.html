        <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Overview</h6>
        <h6>Before I arrived at Carnegie Mellon, I had never programmed before. A few weeks after class started, I began working for a psychology professor as a research engineer on his project. 4 months later I landed a software engineering internship with the Apple notes team.</h6>
        <h6>Unfortunately, the specifics of the work I did at Apple is confidential, though I'm able to share general information.</h6>
        <h6>My internship lasted 11 weeks and consisted of working on an experimental project. Though I was primarily responsible for the project, I worked closely with the other 8 members of my team.</h6>
        <br>
        <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Scope</h6>
        <h6>I was given an open-ended feature-level problem to solve through research, prototyping, and a full implementation into the Notes codebase.</h6>
        <div class="row" id="middle_row">

            <br>
            <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Process</h6>
            <h6>I completed a competitve analysis and did user research, including interviews as well assessing online reviews and the complaints log. Then I prototyped the system on paper, soliciting feedback from team members and other interns. I was limited to these groups due to confidentiality rules.</h6>
            <h6>Throughout the process, I made both design decisions regarding how the user interacted with the feature and their overall mental model of it. The system architecture and protocol design I used ultimately affects the ability of my team members to later access and modify the code that I wrote. The overall design will be a critical consideration when evaluating my feature for release.</h6>

        <h6 class="orange-text text-darken-2 subhead">Completion</h6>
        <h6>At the end of the 11 week internship, I finished implementing the first version of my feature, and made modifications through the standard review process. I also presented my final product and process work to a Senior Director and many managers in my department.</h6>
